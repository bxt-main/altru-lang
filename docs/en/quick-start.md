# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Altru programming language! This guide will help you get started with understanding the language design.

## Getting Started

1. **Project Overview** (`../README.md`) - Understand the vision and goals
2. **Core Design Principles** (`design-principles.md`) - Learn the fundamental philosophy  
3. **Specification v0.2.1** (`specification-0.2.1-full.md`) - Detailed language features
4. **Language Comparison** (`language-comparison.md`) - How Altru differs from other languages

## Key Features to Explore

- **AI Integration** (`ai-integration.md`) - How AI assists in development
- **Memory Management** (`memory-management.md`) - Manual control with safety guarantees
- **Concurrency Model** (`concurrency-model.md`) - Multi-layered concurrency support
- **Type System** (`type-system.md`) - Strong static typing with union types
- **Error Handling** (`error-handling.md`) - Result-based error handling
- **Toolchain** (`toolchain.md`) - Development ecosystem

## Next Steps

- Read the [full specification](specification-0.2.1-full.md) for complete details
- Check out the [design principles](design-principles.md) to understand the philosophy
- Explore the [language comparison](language-comparison.md) to see how Altru differs from other languages

This is a design document repository. The actual implementation is not yet started.
