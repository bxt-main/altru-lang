# altru Programming Language - English Documentation

## Project Background

altru is an experimental programming language project developed by a non-programmer with AI assistance. The main purpose of this project is to invite professional programming language developers for technical evaluation and discussion of various open questions.

## Why Create altru?

- **Exploring AI in Programming Language Development**: Testing how AI can assist non-programmers in designing and implementing programming languages
- **Learning Programming Language Theory**: Understanding the fundamentals of compilers, interpreters, and language design through hands-on practice
- **Community Collaboration**: Hoping to leverage the open-source community to receive guidance and suggestions from professional developers

## Project Status

This is a very early experimental project. Code quality, architectural design, and feature implementation may all have serious deficiencies. We sincerely seek feedback and help from professional developers.

## How to Participate

### Technical Evaluation
- Review existing code and architecture
- Provide improvement suggestions
- Point out potential issues and risks

### Design Discussions
- Discuss language feature design
- Suggest syntax and semantics improvements
- Share best practices in programming language design

### Code Contributions
- Fix bugs
- Implement new features
- Improve performance and stability

## Important Notes

Since the author is not a professional programmer, the project may contain:
- Code that doesn't follow best practices
- Inefficient algorithms
- Architectural design flaws
- Security vulnerabilities

We fully understand these issues exist and hope to gradually improve them with community help.
