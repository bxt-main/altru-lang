The current implementation is in early development. Please check the main README.md for project status and contribution guidelines.

## Language Implementation Notes

Since this project is developed by a non-programmer with AI assistance, the implementation may not follow conventional best practices. We welcome suggestions for improvement in:

- Code organization
- Algorithm efficiency  
- Architecture design
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations
